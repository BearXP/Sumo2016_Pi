# Sumo2016_Pi
This is the code that I plan on running on the controller for my 3kg Sumo Robot this year (2016).

The python code will run on a Raspberry Pi B (original), and will need to wirelessly interface with the Arduino Nano on the robot.

Hardware for this code will include a USB gamepad, touchscreen shield, speaker, 5V battery, and a 2.4GHz tranceiver.

Bonus points have been awarded if a minigame can run on the controller.
